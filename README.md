# 🧠 CheckiO Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from [CheckiO](https://checkio.org/).  
Each folder or file corresponds to a specific mission, written in **Python**.

## 🚀 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Improve my Python skills  
- Keep track of my progress over time  
- Share clear and readable solutions with the community  

## 📂 Structure

```text
checkio-solutions/
│
├── home/
│   └── ...
│
├── elementary/
│   ├── duplicate_zeros.py
│   └── ...
│
└── README.md
```

- Each subfolder matches a **CheckiO island** (like *Home*, *Elementary*, *Scientific Expedition*, etc.).
- Each `.py` file contains the mission name and its solution.

## 🧩 Example

```python
def first_word(text: str) -> str:
    return text.split()[0]
```

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- No external dependencies are required.

## 🏁 Notes

This repository is meant for learning and reference purposes only.  
If you're solving the same missions, try to implement your own ideas before checking the solutions.
